<p>New Rome has existed on the grid since April 2006, where it began from modest origins in a starter sandbox - just a few friends getting together and collaborating, waging combat in the old style. Over time, we grew to dominate - our membership bolstered by a reputation built on the corpses of enemy armies. In 2 short years, Rome rose to a membership of 300 active soldiers in the main group, with a booming citizen population around the same size and a consistent pool of recruits.</p> 

<p>This is the Golden Age under Emperor Darckk Trilam, which ended with his ban in late 2007. Through the trial of surviving inactivity and destruction, Rome found new life and enjoyed a new era of grid domination, revolutionizing and updating the entire combat scene on the grid. The Emperor's Legions poured forth, wreaking destruction on all enemies of the Empire with swift vengeance. Talon, VA, ASH, and Sparta - main rivals of New Rome - were all destroyed within the year, beaten into submission by the Imperial fist.</p>

<p>In 2009, a main grid chapter was established by Omnissiah Kharne Spyker during his transfer, with a loyal chapter remaining behind on the TG. During the harsh years, combat changed again - the main grid militaries had abandoned true combat and regressed into rulefaggotry and B&hammering. The Emperor returned to New Rome as Lord Dreadspyke, breathing life back into the Empire and forging the seeds of it's destiny. Now, with it's revolutionary technology, elite tactics, and steadfast Legions, New Rome stands ready to annihilate all enemies, to reaffirm it's dominance over the SL military community, and to bring back the glorious Imperial combat that the grid has not felt for too long. Semper Fidelis!</p>
